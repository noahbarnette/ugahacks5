    Hi {{ name }},
  </p>
  <p>
    Every year, hundreds of students across the US apply to UGAHacks and we are impressed
    by the passion and creativity each one of you have shown in your projects and enthusiasm for attending {{ h_name }}
    in your application.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, there is unfortunately a limit to how many hackers we can accept every year due to the venue size and
    budgetary reasons. At this time,
    we have decided on the initial batch of applicants to accept for {{ h_name }} and your application has been <b>
    waitlisted </b> for the time being.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the next week, the batch of invited applicants will have a chance to confirmed their attendance to {{ h_name }}.
    There is the possibility that some
    may no longer be able to attend the event, so some spots may still open up.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Keep an eye out for any emails from us over the next week as you can still be invited to join us
      at {{ h_name }}!</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, we really appreciate the time you took to apply to our event, and we hope to see you at UGAHacks sometime in
    the future!
  </p>
  <p>
    Have any other questions? Email us at {{ h_contact_email|urlize }}
  </p>
  <p>Best, </p>
  <p>  {{ h_name }} Team</p>
