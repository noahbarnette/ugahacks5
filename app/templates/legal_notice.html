<h2>Liability Release, Covenant Not to Sue, and Ownership Agreement </h2>

<h3>LIABILITY RELEASE </h3>

<p>I hereby assume all the risks of participating in any/all activities associated with University Hackathons ("UGAHacks") and MLH, including, but not limited to, any risks that may arise from negligence or carelessness on the part of UGAHacks, its directors, organizers, volunteers, and affiliated parties, from dangerous or defective equipment or property owned, maintained, or controlled by UGAHacks, its directors, organizers, volunteers, and affiliated parties, or because of their liability without fault. I waive, release, and discharge from any and all liability, including but not limited to, liability arising from the negligence or fault of UGAHacks, its directors, organizers, volunteers, and affiliated parties for my death, disability, personal injury, property damage, properly theft, or actions of any kind which may occur to me as a result of attending and participating in this event, including traveling to and from the event. I agree to indemnify and hold harmless UGAHacks, its directors, organizers, volunteers, and affiliated parties against any and all claims, suits, actions, and/or judgements of any kind whatsoever for liability, damages, and/or compensation brought by me or anyone on my behalf. I understand and recognize that I will be giving up, among other things, all rights to sue for injuries, damages, or losses I may incur and will reimburse UGAHacks, its directors, organizers, volunteers, and affiliated parties for any expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees, incurred by UGAHacks in connection with, arising out of, or relating in any way to the event and/or this agreement. </p>

<h3>DAMAGES</h3>

<p>I agree to reimburse UGAHacks and the Zell Miller Learning Center for any damages to property owned, maintained, or controlled by UGAHacks and the Zell Miller Learning Center, including, but not limited to, art installations, hackathon equipment, and the venue itself. </p>

<h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & OWNERSHIP </h3>

<p>UGAHacks will receive no ownership of any projects. Equal ownership of projects will be assigned to each team member. Each team member is granted a full, non-exclusive, free license
 to the other to use any code or binaries which may arise from the project. An amendment can be made to override this portion of the agreement at the time of signing with all team members present by
 stating ownership/rights by emailing hackathon@uga.edu before signing. </p>

<h3>PRIVACY</h3>
<p>I agree and understand that the event may be photographed, videotaped, and recorded and hereby grant
  UGAHacks the irrevocable right, in perpetuity, to use my name and likeness without my approval or review and without
  compensation in any manner or media that UGAHacks sees fit. I agree that this data, along with registration data, may be
  shared with third party organizations. </p>

<h3>ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE</h3>

<p>This Agreement may be executed by providing an electronic signature under the terms of the
  Electronic Signatures Act, 15 U.S.C. SS 7001 et. seq., and may not be denied legal effect solely because it is
  in electronic form or permits the completion of the business transaction referenced herein electronically instead of
  in person. </p>
